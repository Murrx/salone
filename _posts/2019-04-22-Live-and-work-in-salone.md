Between 2008-2014 I had been used to moving places in average once a year and to travel a lot. After I have been living  more than 3 years in beautiful Amersfoort (longer than I had ever thought) and had been volunteering on Lesbos, Greece last year I increasingly had this tingling feeling again that I want to go abroad (much further than the Netherlands ;-) ) and explore something new. Since my studies I always had the ambition to live and work in a foreign country in the South for a few years. Now with Rob, I also found the perfect partner in order to dare taking this step. We are both convinced it would be great to share such an experience and go on an adventure together.
 
While we knew that for Rob, being a software engineer, it would be easier than for me to find work abroad, I started looking and applying for jobs basically on every continent. Then in December 2018, I got the offer from Brot für die Welt to work with a partner organisation in Sierra Leone. Rob and I gave it some good thought and then decided to go for it.
 
I will be working with the Sierra Leone Network on the Right to Food (SiLNoRF). It was established in 2008 and encompasses 15 civil society organisations.
Agriculture is a key economic factor in the country, whereby the majority of the population in Sierra Leone work in subsistence agriculture. A very controversial issue hereby are the many foreign investors that grow palmoil or agrofuels on huge pieces of land. This is why SiLNoRF advocates and lobbies for the right to land and food on a local, national and international level and make sure that all stakeholders are engaged and listened to during the planning of land leasing. To make such advocacy work most effective, reliable & evidence-based information, as well as good internal & external communication are essential. Together with my local counter part, the communication officer, my role will be to strengthen SiLNoRF herein, for example through the development of a knowledge management system (who knows what? What should be shared internally/externally? How? Etc.)
 
 
I can really recommend you watching this short documentary (in German) about a very famous and controversial case of land leasing by the international company Addax. It is really nicely made in cooperation with SiLNoRF. You can get a good impression of the organization I will be working with and its context:

For the Dutch speaking, I can suggest this article by De Volkskrant:
[www.volkskrant.nl](https://www.volkskrant.nl/mensen/landroof-in-ruil-voor-loze-beloftes~b6565eb1).
 
While thematically my interest had been always more about migration, I am very curious about this exciting topic of land government and the challenges around land grabbing. And obviously, I hope to add some value with my knowledge on capacity building, policy-influencing and external perspective. I am especially happy about the fact that I’ll be working with a local organization on the ground (instead of sitting in the office of an international organization), as it gives me the opportunity to learn most about the topic but also the culture and the people.
Many people have either never heard of the country, or only think of poverty,  the civil war and Ebola when they hear the name. And honestly I didn’t know a lot about it as well. But I think this makes it even more exciting and valuable to get to know the country - with its people, culture, history, beautiful and challenging sides -as good as possible.
And I hope I will be able to convey some of it through this blog- maybe making you curious to explore it yourself!

For a while now I have been playing with the thought of living and working in a foreign country for a couple years, to learn about different cultures, develop my skills from a different context and to see something of the world. Now we finally got this chance.

Currently I'm traveling to Sierra Leone without a job,
so if all goes wrong I will be forced to spend about 3 years in a hammock, sipping cocktails, while Hanna is working her ass of. 

Of course we don't want that to happen now, do we?
