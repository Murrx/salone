## What is the plan?
We simply want to have a fun and cozy weekend with our friends and family before we leave! That is why it is so essential you come ðŸ˜‰ 
We will not plan a whole program for the weekend but just leave it up to everyone what you want to do during the day.
So feel free to bring nice games, great idea's, silly jokes and anything else that comes to mind.

### Friday:
Many of you might know already that Friday we will first get married in Baarn- yes, you read correctly ðŸ˜‰ - we will do this in a small circle of mainly family and a few close friend.
We would like to keep the ceremonial part of the wedding small, and focus on the goodbye party instead.
Hopefully there will be a big ceremonial wedding party after we return from Sierra Leone, if we still find it a good idea by then... ðŸ˜‰ 
We will arrive at the camping early evening on Friday.
Everyone who was not invited for the wedding ceremony is welcome to join us from this moment on.
We would like to organize a potluck dinner around 7.30pm.
That means everybody brings a bit of food and drinks (salads, bread, dips, etc.) to share with each other. Depending on the weather we can do a pick-nick or eat in our common room. 

### Saturday:
With regards to breakfast and lunch, we will buy simple food that you can take yourself from the kitchen. We will include: Coffee, tea, milk, juice, bread, muesli, yoghurt, cheese, butter, jam, Nutella, hagelslag, vegetarian spread. If you want anything else (e.g. fruit, other drinks during the day, etc.) or have a specific diet please understand that we cannot take everything into account with so many people and take it yourself.

In terms of activities, just enjoy your day! You can do whatever you feel like, play some games, talk to the many horses around, go for a run/walk/hike in the beautiful Veluwezoom, have a coffee at a cafe, or just chill in the sun. We'll also bring â€˜Wikinger Schachâ€™, a Slack-line and games and put them in the common room for everybody. Of course, you can also start planning your visit to Sierra Leone at our 'info stand' ðŸ™‚ 

In the evening around 7pm we will all meet at our 'Western Saloon'- the common room. We arrange a catering for dinner and then spend the evening there together with drinks, music, campfire & marshmallows and of course silly jokes and good conversations. Those who donâ€™t feel like camping are welcome to join us during the party. In this case, please let us know, so we can count you in for the catering. We will provide water, beer, juice, soda, beer and whine and of course Chocomel. If you want anything else to drink, please bring it yourself.

### Sunday:
Again, you can take breakfast from the common room and further do what you feel like.
We will have to say goodbye around noon, as we have to be in Bonn on Monday for another training.
You can still enjoy the area as long as you want. Please note that camping checkout is till 11am.

## Where will we stay?
It was not easy due to high season but we managed to find a nice camping location to stay with our group. Check out the location here: [https://www.campingboszicht.nl/](https://www.campingboszicht.nl/).
Camping Boszicht is a camping focused on horse friends- meaning people bring their horses with them to the camping. No, you haven't missed a secret obsession of us with horses- it just fulfilled most of our wishes that we had for this weekend:

1.	It has a nice room that we can use for our party, eating and storing food, as well as just hanging out if you want to be inside. We have a kitchen there, which has all necessary kitchen utensil's, incl. coffee machine and several fridges. Plates, cups and cutlery are available as well.

2.	It has different sleeping options available- so you can choose whether you want to sleep in your tent, camper bus or rent a hut. While there will also be other guests, including long-term guest, on the camping, we asked the reception to locate our group close to each other so we can create a bit of our own space.  Most of our tents will be located around a playground where the kids can play. Of course, if you want to be more to yourself or closer to the common room (because of kids or anything) just inform the reception.

3.   Last but not least, we chose for this location because it is located next to the Veluwezoom, which is one of our favorite locations  in the Netherlands. Within a few minutes you are in a beautiful forest.

A SPAR supermarket is within walking distance from the camping grounds.

If you have any questions about the location, please check the information provided on the [camping website](https://www.campingboszicht.nl/) 

### What to bring?
*	Camping materials
*	Pick-nick blanket
*	Food to share at dinner on Friday and any other specific food or drinks 
*	Plates, cups and cutlery for breakfast and lunch
*	Hiking or running shoes 
*	You know we love to dance, so don't forget your dancing shoes and outfit
*	games, instruments, magic tricks- anything that you like to bring to enjoy a nice time together

## Presents?
We do not expect you to stress out to find the perfect present for us, just so that we have to store it in a dusty basement for the coming 3 years, because we have no space in our suitcase to take it along.

Because the organization of this weekend (including food and drinks) is quite expensive a financial contribution would be most appreciated (expected!!) present  ðŸ˜‰ 

Also, if you want to make sure that we don't forget you, consider bringing a nice/crazy/silly picture of yourself and put it in our 'friendship book' during the weekend.
