## What is the plan?
`TODO: Foto?Boszicht? camping picture of us in wales?dancing?`
Very simply, we want to have a fun and cozy weekend with our friends and family before we leave! That is why it is so essential you come ðŸ˜‰ 
We will not plan a whole program for the weekend but just leave it up to everyone what you want to do during the day.

### Friday:
Many of you might know already that Friday we will first get married in Baarn- yes, you read correctly ðŸ˜‰ - we will do this in a small circle of mainly family and a few close friends. The whole weekend though will be more under the header of spending time together before we leave- the real big wedding ceremony and party will be organized when we return from Sierra Leone and still find it a good idea haha...
We will arrive at the camping early evening on Friday. For those who are there then, too- we would like to organize a potluck dinner around 7.30pm. That means everybody brings a bit of food and drinks (salads, bread, dips, etc.) to share with each other. Depending on the weather we can do a picnic or eat in our common room. 

### Saturday:
With regards to breakfast and lunch, we will buy simple food that you can take yourself from the kitchen. We'll do our best to make a good estimation of how much we need, but also please keep in mind that we are with many people. We will include: Coffee, tea, milk, juice, bread, muesli, yoghurt, cheese, butter, jam, Nutella, hagelslag, vegetarian spread. If you want anything else (e.g. fruit, other drinks during the day, etc.) or have a specific diet please understand that we cannot take everything into account with so many people and take it yourself. Also, there are cafes and restaurants around if you want to eat out for lunch or some cake in the afternoon.

In terms of activities, just enjoy your day! You can do whatever you feel like, play some games, talk to the many horses around, go for a run/walk/hike in the beautiful Veluwezoom, have a coffee at a cafe, or just chill in the sun. We'll also bring â€˜Wikinger Schachâ€™, a Slack-line and games and put them in the common room for everybody. Of course, you can also start planning your visit to Sierra Leone at our 'info stand' ðŸ™‚ 

In the evening around 7pm we will all meet at our 'Western Saloon'- the common room. We arrange a catering for dinner and then spend the evening there together with drinks, music, campfire & marshmallows and of course silly jokes and good conversations. Those who donâ€™t feel like camping are welcome to join us during the party. In this case, please let us know, so we can count you in for the catering. If you want anything else to drink than water, juice, soda, beer or wine- please bring it yourself.

### Sunday:
Again, you can take breakfast from the common room and further do what you feel like. You can still enjoy the area as long as you want. If you booked until Sunday though you need to check out at 11:00h.
We (Hanna & Robin) will leave around noon, as we have to be in Bonn on Monday for another training.


## Where will we stay?
It was not easy due to high season but in the end we found a nice camping location to stay with our group. Check out the location here: [https://www.campingboszicht.nl/](https://www.campingboszicht.nl/).
Camping Boszicht is a camping focused on horse friends- meaning people bring their horses with them to the camping. No, you haven't missed a secret obsession of us with horses- it just fulfilled most of our wishes that we had for this weekend:

1.	It has a nice room that we can use for our party, eating and storing food, as well as just hanging out if you want to be inside. We have a kitchen there, which has all necessary kitchen utensil's, incl. coffee machine and several fridges. Plates, cups and cutlery are available as well.

2.	It has different sleeping options available- so you can choose whether you want to sleep in your tent, camper bus or rent a hut. While there will also be other guests, including long-term guest, on the camping, we asked the reception to locate our group close to each other so we can create a bit of our own space.  Most of our tents will be located around a playground where the kids can play. Of course, if you want to be more to yourself or closer to the common room (because of kids or anything) just inform the reception.

3.   Last but not least, we chose for this location because it is located next to the Veluwezoom, which is a beautiful nature area. Within a few minutes you are in a nice forest.

A SPAR supermarket is within walking distance from the camping grounds

What to bring?
*	all camping material that you need
*	picknick blanket

*	hiking or running shoes 
*	you know we love to dance, so don't forget your dancing shoes

# Presents?
We do not expect you to stress out to find the perfect present for us, just so that we have to store it for the coming 3 years in a dusty basement, because we have no space in our suitcase to take it along.

Because the organization of this weekend, including food and drinks, is quite expensive a financial contribution would be most appreciated (expected!!)

Also, if you really want to make sure that we don't forget you, consider bringing a nice/crazy/silly picture of yourself and put it in the 'friendship book' during the weekend.
