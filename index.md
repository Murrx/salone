As you may already know we will be moving to Makeni, Sierra Leone in September of this year.
Hanna will be working for the local organization SILNORF via the
German organization 'Brot f√ºr die Welt'
and Robin is in the lucky position to be her accompanying partner. 

Via this blog we will keep you updated on our experiences
